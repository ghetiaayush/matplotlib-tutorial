# Introduction 
- Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. 
- It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. 
- Matplotlib is written in Python and makes use of NumPy, the numerical mathematics extension of Python. 
- It provides an object-oriented API that helps in embedding plots in applications using Python GUI toolkits such as PyQt, WxPythonotTkinter. 
- It can be used in Python and IPython shells, Jupyter notebook and web application servers also.
- Matplotlib has a procedural interface named the Pylab, which is designed to resemble MATLAB, a proprietary programming language developed by MathWorks. 
- Matplotlib along with NumPy can be considered as the open source equivalent of MATLAB.
- Matplotlib was originally written by John D. Hunter in 2003. The current stable version is 2.2.0 released in January 2018.
